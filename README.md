# Machine-Learning-Powered-Image-Cartoonification
This project demonstrates how to transform an image into a "cartoon" version by applying various image processing techniques such as Gaussian Blur, Median Blur, Bilateral Filter, and edge detection with Laplacian filters. The project also reduces the color space using K-Means clustering to create the cartoon effect.
